# üõ°Ô∏è Green Pace Security Policy Project  

## üìå Project Overview  
This repository contains the complete deliverables for **CS-405: Secure Coding** Project Two. The project centers on the design, documentation, and presentation of a **comprehensive security policy** for *Green Pace*, a fictional software development company.  

The goal of this project was to learn how to design security policies that integrate **coding standards, risk analysis, encryption, authentication and authorization controls (AAA), and automation within a DevSecOps pipeline**. By completing this work, I strengthened my ability to design systems that are not just functional, but also **secure by design**, aligning with modern software engineering practices.

## üß† Key Skills and Lessons Learned  

This project was more than just writing a policy ‚Äî it was a **hands-on experience in security engineering**.  

### üîπ Secure by Design  
- Learned that **security must be integrated from the start**, not bolted on at the end.  
- Practiced embedding secure coding standards (CERT C/C++) into the development lifecycle.  
- Understood how small issues like buffer overreads (STR32-C) or integer conversions (INT31-C) can escalate into major exploits.  

### üîπ Risk Assessment and Prioritization  
- Developed a **Threat Matrix** ranking vulnerabilities by severity, likelihood, and remediation cost:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- Learned to **prioritize fixes**: High-risk vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately, while low-risk issues can be deferred strategically to manage technical debt.  
- Gained experience balancing **business constraints** with **security needs** (cost-benefit tradeoffs).  

### üîπ Encryption Policies  
- Implemented **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest.  
- Applied **TLS/IPSec protocols** for encryption in flight.  
- Studied emerging techniques like **encryption-in-use** (secure enclaves, homomorphic encryption) for protecting data being processed:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
- Learned how to **write practical encryption policies** that define not only technology, but also when, where, and why encryption should be applied.  

### üîπ AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)  
- Learned how to enforce **Authentication** using MFA and identity checks.  
- Designed **Authorization policies** with least-privilege and role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Emphasized **Accounting and logging** as critical to audits, compliance, and detecting insider threats.  

### üîπ DevSecOps and Automation  
- Built understanding of **security automation** across the SDLC.  
- Integrated **Clang warnings, static analysis (CodeSonar, Coverity, Axivion), and formal analysis (Astree, √âCLAIR)** directly into CI/CD pipelines:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
- Automated unit testing, regression testing, and dependency scanning to ensure every code commit was validated.  
- Learned that automation reduces human error, ensures repeatability, and enforces security at scale.  

### üîπ Zero Trust Model  
- Adopted the mindset that **no user, device, or network should be trusted by default**.  
- Understood how Zero Trust strengthens defense against insider threats, lateral movement, and misconfigurations.  
- Realized that **continuous validation** is more reliable than perimeter defenses.  

### üîπ Professional Skills  
- Practiced **communicating technical policies** to both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Built **formal documentation** (policies, risk assessments, automation strategies).  
- Developed **presentation and storytelling skills** through the script and slide deck.  
- Gained confidence in **tying principles (like least privilege) to standards (like DCL51-CPP or MEM54-CPP)**, demonstrating that security decisions are grounded in best practices.
